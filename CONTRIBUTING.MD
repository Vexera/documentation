# Contributing to the Vexera's documentation
Every contribution is important. It doesn't matter if you just want to fix that tiny grammar or spelling error, or want to write whole pages.</br>
Don't hesitate to submit one because it's a *small* change!

## Rules
 1. Don't submit unrelated changes through the same pull request (= submit a new pull request for each change).
 2. Before making big changes, discuss them on the <a href="https://discord.gg/VzbRGWF" target="_blank">official Vexera server</a>.
 3. We normally merge pull requests by squashing all commits to have a clean history in the master branch. Exceptions apply (see rule #4).
 4. When you are doing big changes, you may want to split the changes into multiple commits. To have them merged as is, be sure to not have commits like `Fixing previous commit`.
 5. To comply with the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" target="_blank">CC BY-NC license</a>, if you import changes on the behalf of someone else, don't forget to set the author of your commits to the original author of the changes.

## How to submit changes
* ### You don't have push access to this repository
	* **Short way (easy, if you don't know how to use git)**
		 1. Go to the file that you want to change
		 2. Make your changes
		 3. Under `Commit changes`, add a short summary of your changes in the first textbox (mandatory)
		 4. If needed, you can add more information in the second textbox
		 5. Click `Propose file change`. This will fork the repository for you and create a branch, where your changes will be committed
		 6. Submit the pull request
		 7. Reply to the comments and reviews of the pull request if needed
 

	* **Long way (more complex, if you know how to use git)**
		 1. [Fork the repository](https://gitlab.com/Vexera/documentation/fork)
		 2. Create a branch for your changes
		 3. Make your changes
		 4. Submit a pull request for the `master` branch
		 5. Reply to comments and reviews of the pull request if needed

* ### You have push access to the repository
Same than above, but you can create your branch in the main repository directly (**don't push to master!**).
