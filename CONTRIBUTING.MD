# Contributing to the Vexera's documentation
Every contributions are important, from those who fix grammar and spelling errors to those who write whole pages.
Don't hesitate to submit one because it's a *small* change!

## Rules
 1. Don't submit unrelated changes in the same pull request (= submit a new pull request for each changes).
 2. Before making big changes, discuss them on the [official server](https://discord.gg/VzbRGWF).
 3. Unless some exceptions (see below), we will merge pull requests by squashing all commits to have a clean history in the master branch.
 4. When you are doing big changes, you may want to split the changes into multiple commits. To have them merged as is, be sure to not have commits like `Fixing previous commit`.
 5. To comply with the [CC BY-NC license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), if your import changes on the behalf of someone else, don't forget to set the author of your commits to the original author of the changes.
