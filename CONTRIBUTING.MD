# Contributing to the Vexera's documentation
Every contributions are important, from those who fix grammar and spelling errors to those who write whole pages.
Don't hesitate to submit one because it's a *small* change!

## Rules
 1. Don't submit unrelated changes in the same pull request (= submit a new pull request for each changes).
 2. Before making big changes, discuss them on the [official server](https://discord.gg/VzbRGWF).
 3. Unless some exceptions (see below), we will merge pull requests by squashing all commits to have a clean history in the master branch.
 4. When you are doing big changes, you may want to split the changes into multiple commits. To have them merged as is, be sure to not have commits like `Fixing previous commit`.
 5. To comply with the [CC BY-NC license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), if your import changes on the behalf of someone else, don't forget to set the author of your commits to the original author of the changes.

## How to submit changes

		 5. Click "Propose file change". This will fork the repository for you and create a branch where your changes will be committed

	* #### Long way (to do more complex stuffs, if you know how to use git)
		 1. [Fork the repository](https://gitlab.com/Vexera/documentation/fork)
		 2. Create a branch for your changes
		 3. Make your changes
		 4. Submit a pull request against the `master` branch

Same than above, but you can create your branch in the main repository directly (**don't push to master!**).
