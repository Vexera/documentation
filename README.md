# Vexera's documentation
This repository holds the documentation, which is published on https://vexera.io

## How does this work?
All of the documentation is written in <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/" target="_blank">markdown</a> formatted files.</br>
These files are then parsed by our magic website code before serving them over the world.

## Can I contribute?
Sure, everybody is welcome to help making this doc the best ever!</br>
Every contribution is important. It doesn't matter if you just want to fix that tiny grammar or spelling error, or want to write whole pages.
