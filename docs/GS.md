# Getting Started

This is where you can read how to get started with everything.  
For getting started with Music, check [this article](/docs/music) and for frequently asked questions, check [this article](/docs/faq).

## Inviting Vexera

Getting Vexera running on your server is pretty easy, first, check if you have either the `Administrator` or the `Manage Server` *permission*.  
> Server owners have all permissions even without roles.  

If you have those permissions, you can use [**this link**](/invite) to **invite** Vexera.  
Make sure you are logged onto the *right account* in Discord to be able to authenticate.  

### You should see a screen like that:
There, just grant Vexera the `Administrator` permission, choose a server and invite Vexera to your server.
> Be warned, that Vexera doesn't **require** this permission and can also be manually assigned permissions at your discretion,
> but try not to play around with Vexera's permissions if you don't know what you are doing. 
> You can find more information about **Discord's permission system** [here](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/214836687-Role-Management-101).
