# Documentation
Welcome to Vexera's documentation page!

Vexera is a **free Discord music bot** with other lots of other **features**. This documentation was made to assist users with using Vexera's features.  
The bot is made to be very simple to use and to get to what you want to do with it very fast.  

To get Vexera running on your server, check if you either have the `Administrator` or the `Manage Server` *permission*.  
> Server owners have all permissions even without roles.  

If you have those permissions, you can use [**this link**](/invite) to invite Vexera.  
Make sure you are logged onto the *right account* in Discord to be able to authenticate.  

### You should see a screen like that:
There, just grant Vexera the `Administrator` permission, choose a server and invite Vexera to your server.
> Be warned, that Vexera doesn't **require** this permission and can also be manually assigned permissions at your descretion
> but try not to play around with Vexera's permissions if you don't know what you are doing. 
> You can find more information about **Discord's permission system** [here](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/214836687-Role-Management-101).
