# Fun, Meme and Images
Vexera does not only provide an excellent music- and administration system, but also **funny commands to play around with**.

## Fun-Commands

Those commands are pretty much commands for quick jokes and other stuff.

1. Ask the magic 8ball
    * To ask your favor, do `+8ball <query>` and Vexera will respond.
2. Convert text into ASCII
    * Want to have some nice custom ASCII-text? Just run `+8ball <font> <text>`.
    * A list of fonts can be found [here](https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/tree/master/fonts).
3. Want some jokes? These commands are for you then.
    * You demand a Chuck Norris joke? Run `+chucknorris`
    * You feel more like a yomamma joke? Run `+yomamma`
4. Emotify your text!
    * You want to bring some color into your text? Run `+emojify [text]`
5. Want to look up a word quickly?
    * Then `+urban [query]` is for you!
