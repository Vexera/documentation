# Fun, Memes and Images
Vexera does not only provide an excellent music and administration system, but also **funny commands to play around with**.

## Fun Commands

Those commands are pretty much commands for quick jokes and other stuff.

1. Ask the **magic 8ball**
    * To ask your favor, do `+8ball <Query>` and Vexera will respond.
2. Convert text into **ASCII**
    * Want to have some nice custom ASCII text? Just run `+ascii <Font> <Text>`.
    * A list of fonts can be found [here](https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/tree/master/fonts).
3. Want some **jokes**? These commands are for you then.
    * Demand a Chuck Norris joke? Run `+chucknorris`
    * Feel more like a yomamma joke? Run `+yomamma`
4. **Emotify** your text!
    * Want to bring some color into your text? Run `+emojify <text>`
5. Want to **look up a word** quickly?
    * Then `+urban <Query>` is for you!

## Meme Commands

Want to meme around with your friends? This is for you then.

1. Create a **funny image** which tells users what's better
    * To create one of these, use `+drake <Good> <Bad>`
    * 'Good' and 'Bad' can be either users (mentions) or links to pictures.
2. Create **high quality images**
    * So if you just want to improve the quality of an image you can use `+jpeg <Image>`
    * To improve it even more, using Vexera's implemented photoshop software, use `+magik <Image>` for images or `+gmagik <Gif>` for GIFs.
3. Create a **handicapped image**
    * To transfer your friends into a very smart person, do `+handicapped <Image> <Text>`
    * Feel free to try that out yourself. The 'Image' argument can be a link of an image or User.
4. Create a **whodidthis image**.
    * This command is to literally make a 'whodidthis' image. Feel free to try it out using `+whodidthis <Image>`
5. Someone made a **HUGE mistake**? This is for them then.
    * Do `+mistake <Image>` to document this for future researches.
6. Want to show your friends how huge (or not) your **penis** is?
    * You can do that now! Use `+penis` for yourself and `+penis <User>` for another user.
    * Hint: If you use this command in a nsfw-channel, the symbols will be changed to emotes.

### Detecting Images
Vexera can **detect** the last posted picture to use for a command.<br/>
Try it out by uploading an image in Discord in a specific channel and using any meme command, such as `+mistake`.

## Image Commands

Are you a *little bored*? These commands will help you!

1. Want some **cute images**?
    * You can either make Vexera generate a dog, cat or doge image using `+dog`, `+cat` or `+doge`.
2. Want a **weeb image**?
    * You have a wide list of weebs to generate, check them using `+weeb list` and use `+weeb <Type>` at the end.
3. Want to read a **comic**?
    * You can get a XKCD comic using `+xkcd <Comic>`.
