# Fun, Meme and Images
Vexera does not only provide an excellent music- and administration system, but also **funny commands to play around with**.

## Fun-Commands

Those commands are pretty much commands for quick jokes and other stuff.

1. Ask the **magic 8ball**
    * To ask your favor, do `+8ball <query>` and Vexera will respond.
2. Convert text into **ASCII**
    * Want to have some nice custom ASCII-text? Just run `+8ball <font> <text>`.
    * A list of fonts can be found [here](https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/tree/master/fonts).
3. Want some **jokes**? These commands are for you then.
    * You demand a Chuck Norris joke? Run `+chucknorris`
    * You feel more like a yomamma joke? Run `+yomamma`
4. **Emotify** your text!
    * You want to bring some color into your text? Run `+emojify <text>`
5. Want to **look up a word** quickly?
    * Then `+urban <query>` is for you!

## Meme-Commands

Want to meme around with your friends? This is for you then.

1. Create a **funny image** which tells people what's better
    * To create one of these, run `+drake <good> <bad>`
    * 'Good' and 'Bad' can be either people (mentions) or links of pictures.
2. Create **high-quality images**
    * So if you just want to improve the quality of an image you can use `+jpeg <image>`
    * To improve it even more and use Vexera's implemented photoshop software do `+magik <image>` or for GIFs `+gmagik <gif>`
3. Create a **handicapped image**
    * To transfer your friends into a very smart person do `+handicapped <image> <text>`
    * Feel free to try that out yourself. The 'image' argument can be a link of an image or a mention.
4. Create a **whodidthis image**.
    * This command is to literally make a 'whodidthis' image. Feel free to try it out using `+whodidthis <image>`
5. Want to pass a **new law** issued by *Donald Trump*? This is for you.
    * Do `+illegal <text>` to officially forbid something around the world.
6. Someone made a **HUGE mistake**? This is for you then.
    * Do `+mistake <image>` to document this for future researches.

### Detecting Images
Vexera can **detect** the last posted picture to use for a command.  
Try it out by uploading an image in Discord in a specific channel and use as example the `+mistake` command.
