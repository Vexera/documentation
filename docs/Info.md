### Wolfram
Want a **fast answer to a question**? Wolfram is for you!<br/>
Wolfram can tell you nearly everything you want to know, try out some stuff like `+wolfram sqrt(9)` or `+wolfram capital of canada`.

### Logo
Want to get your own Vexera logo? We have a command for that!<br/>
To create it, you would have to run this command: `+logo "<title>" "<description>"`.<br/>
For you to understand it easier, here's an example: `+logo "Vexera" "is awesome!"`<br/>
