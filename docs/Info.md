# Info & Miscellaneous

There are some commands which are not used very often but are **pretty useful anyways**.<br/>
These are listed here.

## Info Commands

Commands which display **general information** about specific stuff.

### General info commands
* To get a **more-compressed** list of commands, use `+help`.
* To check if the bot is online, or if it **responds** in general, do `+ping`.  
* In order to get the **invite-link** once more, do `+invite`
* To check the current **voice-connections, servers, users** and **much more**, do `+stats`.

##### Advanced info commands

### Premium
You have some **premium info commands** too:  

* You can get more **info** about premium by using `+premium`.  
* To check the currenly set **premium messages** or set your own, do `+donators [Text]`. Your text will be displayed on top if your pledge on Patreon is **higher** than the ones displayed.

## Miscellanous Commands

There are some commands which can be **pretty helpful** sometimes.

### Checking invites
You can check the **amount of users a user has invited** using invites which are *still active*.<br/>
Invites which have been deleted are not included in this value. To use the command, do `+invites <User>.`

### Server & Userinfo
To get some useful *information about a user*, do `+userinfo <User>`.<br/>
To get the same, but for the server, do `+serverinfo`

### Wolfram
Want a **fast answer to a question**? Wolfram is for you!<br/>
Wolfram can tell you nearly everything you want to know, try out some stuff like `+wolfram sqrt(9)` or `+wolfram capital of canada`.

### Logo
Want to get your own Vexera-logo? We have an API for that!<br/>
To create it, you would have to run this command: `+logo "<Title>" "<Description>"`.<br/>
For you to understand it easier, here's an example: `+logo "Vexera" "is awesome!"`<br/>
